            We've been spending a significant time and effort to make our internal tools better. We
            are delivering around 7000 portions of food per week. Our daily operations team was in
            need of better tools to help them manage the daily operations. This will also help us
            re-phrasing some issues we've bee dealing with before. Now the operations team can solve
            some problems that previously they needed the software team help.

            I'm almost finished with updating our data to match our new data structure. This had a
            lot of tinkering and updating data. This is also a step towards making our billing
            system better. It works, but it's not very user friendly.

            I like the execute programming method of courses since they use spaced-repition. I
            believe that is on of the best way to learn.
